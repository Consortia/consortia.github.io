It kind of seems like the obvious choice in this day and age.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I wanted to have the latest posts appear on our site as well without any of us needing to update and redeploy the site each time a new article is published because we want to expose the content directly to our visitors who wouldn’t necessarily be inclined to visit the blog specifically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As it turns out this is not so easy to do, unless you are a developer and know how to work with APIs.
Being a designer and a basic front-ender, I figured there has to be a way to do this with the almighty jQuery. After some googling I’ve stumbled upon several hints that made me think it might be possible, and it involves getting JSON-formatted content from Medium, and parsing it into your HTML with jQuery.&lt;/p&gt;
